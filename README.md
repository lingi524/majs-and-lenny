A website for my two women book club using React, Contentful and Netlify (that's the plan anyway). This is my personal project for my last term at the Frontend Developer program at Hyper Island. The book club has used an excel document to document our reads until now, and I thought it was time for an update to our "database".

 Make a website with a headless CMS attached<br>
 Make a finalized design in Figma before moving on to code<br>
 Keep track of my project with a Kanban board<br>
 Pass the assessment from Hyper Island
 
<h1>📕 Learnings:</h1>
More experience with React<br>
More experience with using Github through the terminal<br>
